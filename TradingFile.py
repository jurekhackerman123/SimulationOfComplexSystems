'''
In this file, we have a function that takes a simulated stock and a trading strategy. 

All the trading strategy functions return True or False, indicating if it is a good idea to buy (or sell) given 
the day and the stock and of course, the trading strategy that is follow. 

Buy and Hold for instance will return False always, unless we reached the last end of the time period that was simulated.
